## Basic Guidelines

This repository is essentially your version of the research paper in a normal capston.  So here's a few guidelines.

* This must be well written and laid out.  We don't need perfect flowing prose, but it should be clean and free of gramatical errors.
* Keep formatting consistent.
* You should have links to important parts of the repository.  Don't make the reader hunt for information.
* Images and diagrams are not required, but they do add to the overall user experience.
