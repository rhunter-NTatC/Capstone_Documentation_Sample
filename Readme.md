## Basic Guidelines

This repository is essentially your version of the research paper in a normal capstone.  So here's a few guidelines.

* Think of your repository as a publishable document that is how you will pass if you're unable to present.

* This should house <ins>all</ins> aspects of your project.

* This must be well written and laid out.  We don't need perfect flowing prose, but it should be clean and free of grammatical errors.  Copy and paste into a Google Doc to check spelling.

* Keep all formatting consistent.

* All file and folder names should be descriptive.

* You should have links to important parts of the repository.  Don't make the reader hunt for information.

* Images and diagrams are not required, but they do add to the overall user experience.
